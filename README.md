This Spring Boot/React web application simulates a school system database where users can log in as admins, teachers, and students.
Admins can generate new classes, teachers, and students, as well as edit and delete student and teacher data.
Each teacher, assigned to a single class, can view their students' emails and grades, as well as manually enter and edit grades for each student.
Students can view their grades for each class that they are enrolled in.

Execution: With Apache and MySQL running, start by running Demo2Application.java in one window. Then, simultaneously, enter the system-ui folder and type 'npm start' in the terminal of another window. 
This will launch the login page for the application, where users can enter their email and password information.
